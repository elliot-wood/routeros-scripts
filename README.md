#RouterOS Scripts and Notes#

This is a collection of scripts that I have written for use in RouterOS
on my _Mikrotik RouterBOARD_ devices.

I have arranged them by what device I use them on. These devices are:

* YakRouter - RB750Gr3 (hEX) / home router
* YakRemote - mAP 2nD / road warrior router
* YakWAP - wAP ac / CAPsMAN managed wireless access points (three of them)

Also included are my personal notes for each router. These include
configuration snippets, notes about features being used, gotchas
and possibly more.

This repository is considered an archive. Scripts that I no longer use
will be kept on this archive but not maintained, in the hope that
someone else may find them useful.
